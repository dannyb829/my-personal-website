               <h2>Im just a guy...</h2>
               <p>A guy born an raised in Flatbush Brooklyn of Dominican Parents. Fortified by the richness of culture(shout out to my west indians, hatians, jamaicans, boricuas ect..) and the volitility of New York. 
                   I can say that i am proud to have been born there. Wasn't always easy, as with any kid anywhere, you make mistakes and get yelled at by your Mom and Dad. 
                   But with their love and your will you get back up and dust yourself off. Graduated highschool at Erasmus High, and went on to college at CSI in staten island.
                   It was a huge campus and i was ready for the new adventure. I was pursuing an education in electrical engineering. I was doing pretty well, atleast in those core classes. I learned so much and honed so many skills.
                   Unfotunately, though, at some point things became more about money at home, my grades suffered and i ultimately dropped out and got a job as a home attendant...
               </p>
               <p>New to the world of employment, and unsatisfied with the end of my education i was never content with that situation. To add to that my responsibilities
                   were to care for another adult human just as i were to take care of myself. This meant feeding, bathing, clothingand even administering medication. The noblest of work,
                   but definitely not my life passion. That job did teach me much patience though. In enough time i decided to do something else. I had a family member that was doing uber at the time, explained to me how simple it was.
                   That all i needed was a car and to get my taxi license. Which i did. It was high time to do something else. I started doing uber back in 2015, and I loved it. I could make my own schedule,
                   drive how ever long i wanted, plus i was making good money. I got to go on many vacations, and it afforded me to spend good time with my family. I then met my wife in 2016 and began my best years, 
                   being able to become a proper adult and loving someone at the same time was very exciting, and i soon realized that i was old enough to adventure out and live on my own. My mom wasnt exactly happy,
                   but she knew that i could handle it. Me and my wife shacked up and began grindin on our own.
               </p>
               <p>Fast forward, its been a few years and through many struggles my desire to move towards something else grew and grew and grew. I knew i was not meant to be a driver forever.
                   But for some reason, there was a delay pulling the trigger. I was very much procrastinating on pursuing a new career. Why was it? Was i too comfortable making money on my own time? being able to vacation as i please?
                   Please.. i was not rich doing uber i can tell you that. No, the reality was that it had been so long since i was in a learning environment that i was intimidated.
                   Scarred by abandoning my previous education, i was scared that things would take the same turn as before. And for a while, i had convinced myself that i needed time. But i was lying to myself,
                   I did not just want to move forward. I needed to. I needed to move on and do something great in my life. I had already been researching software engineering, so it felt like destiny when i was driving around a passenger who told me about 
                   the Flatiron school. Though many months of preparation and hyping myself up to take the plunge into this world. I finally did it. And to be honest, I Love it. Here i am today.. writing my very first webpage!!
               </p>
               <p id="lastP">Special shout out to my Mom and Dad, and my brothers and sister and my wife Carolina. My love for my family is what pushes me to do everything i do!</p>
